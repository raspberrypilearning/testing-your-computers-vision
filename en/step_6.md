# What next?
Now that you've got a tool to use your image classification models with, you can create your own model in [Cats vs. dogs](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cats-vs-dogs). In the project, you will take an existing model trained to recognise lots of different kinds of images and retrain it to determine whether the images show cats or dogs.
